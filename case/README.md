# Vertex case

### These files are meant for 3D printing only! 

They are not suitable for CNC machining and trying to use them for that will most likely result in failure of the parts.

For assembly you need 4x m2x10mm screws for the case and 8x m2x8mm screws to mount the plate.  
The three pieces that make the bottom half of the case have tabs on the sides for glueing them together.  
It's not strictly necessary to do this but it helps with the overall rigidity of the case assembly.

More alternative options will be added later.

The currently supported layout looks like this.
